<h1>Arya</h1>
<p>A big part of ASOIAF is about examining the human toll that the kind of massive upheaval seen in epic fantasy would have, and none of the POV characters does that better than Arya. I don’t know if she’s different in the show, but a lot of the criticism and praise I see for Arya focusses on how badass she is and portrays her as invincible. One of the reasons I usually see for disliking her or her story is that they know she’s not going to die anytime soon. I would argue that that applies to a lot of characters; I mean I don’t think anyone thinks Danys going to die of pale mare before she gets to Westeros. There are  actually lots of characters that clearly aren’t going to die before the last book; yes, ASOIAF has less predictable arcs than most series and no one is guaranteed a happy ending, but Martin is still telling a story here, with arcs that require some characters to live through dangerous situations. Aryas been through some of the most insane shit out of any of the characters; her stroy during books 2-3 is basically her trekking across a warzone in a world where war crimes aren’t a concept. When you compare her story with over POVs in dangerous settings, I can see while you might get frustrated that she’s still walking around all in one piece. I mean, there are some characters who can’t seem to step outside without getting a new scar or losing a tooth,  how is it that this preteen girl with no protection is able to move through  all of this devastation with barely a scratch? But I think this doesn’t take into account the horrible psychological damage she’s suffered. Yes, she hasn’t lost any appendages, but in some ways she’s just as crippled as Jamie or Bran. The Starks could be restored to their seat and lands tomorrow, with all the survivors reunited at Winterfell, and Arya would still be screwed for life. Her story is fundamentally about the loss of her humanity.
